## Stock Simple
This is a web application that attempts to simplify the process of understanding finance and the stock market. Users can sign up, track stocks, set up watchlists, test investment strategies, and view the latest news from the stock market. 

***

## Motivation
We decided to make this app because we found that so many of the popular stock based web and mobile applications are complicated for the average user. Furthermore, few of these applications allow users to test their investment strategies without using actual money. For these reasons we decided to make a web application thats strips away unnecessary information and only shows users what they need to know about the stock market and allows for 'fake' investments.
